# Advent of Code 2021

This year I am gonna use TypeScript with Deno ðŸ¦•.

## Day 19

This day is really hard. 3D rotation is so confusing.

My code are basically based on this [ruby solution](https://github.com/0x8b/advent.of.code.each/blob/main/src/2021/19.rb).

It's slow but it works.

## Day 23

Reference: https://github.com/1e9y/adventofcode/blob/main/2021/day23/day23.go

This day seems very hard at the first glance but it's actually a path finding problem and we can use Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm to solve it.

## How to run

- `cd` into the target day
- `deno -A --no-check main.ts < input/input.txt`
